# Flexible RAG: Development and Evaluation Strategies


This course is an extract of a seminar conducted by @Ayush Thakur a prominent Machine Learning Engineer @ Weights & Biases with @Maxim Voisin a Senior Product Manager @Cohere.

Here they present a trailer of their upcomming Full Course titled "RAG++: Taking your RAG beyong POC", in collaboration with Waiviate.

In case you're asking about RAG, no worries we'll explore it.


## 1. What is RAG?

RAG, short for Retrieval Augmented Generation, works by integrating retrieval-based techniques with generative-based AI models. Retrieval-based models excel at extracting information from pre-existing online sources like newspaper articles, databases, blogs, and other knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia or even internal databases. However, such models cannot produce original or unique responses. Alternatively, generative models can generate original responses that are appropriate within the context of what is being asked, but can find it difficult to maintain strict accuracy. To overcome these relative weaknesses in existing models, RAG was developed to combine their respective strengths and minimize their drawbacks. In a RAG-based AI system, a retrieval model is used to find relevant information from existing information sources while the generative model takes the retrieved information, synthesizes all the data, and shapes it into a coherent and contextually appropriate response.


## 2. What are the benefits of retrieval augmented generation?
By integrating retrieval and generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, RAG delivers responses that are more accurate, relevant, and original while also sounding like they came from humans. That’s because RAG models can understand the context of queries and generate fresh and unique replies by combining the best of both models. By doing this, RAG models are:

#### 2.1. More accurate
By first using a retrieval model to identify relevant information from existing knowledge sources, the original human-like responses that are subsequently generated are based on more relevant and up-to-date information than a pure generative model.
#### 2.2. Better at synthesizing information
By combining retrieval and generative models, RAG can synthesize information from numerous sources and generate fresh responses in a human-like way. This is particularly helpful for more complex queries that require integrating information from multiple sources.

#### 2.3. Adept at putting information into context
Unlike simple retrieval models, RAG can generate responses that are aware of the context of a conversation, and are thus more relevant.

#### 2.4. Easier to train
Training an NLP-based large language model (LLM) to build a generative AI model requires a tremendous volume of data. Alternatively, RAG models use pre-existing and pre-retrieved knowledge sources, reducing the need to find and ingest massive amounts of training data.

#### 2.5. More efficient
RAG models can be more efficient than large-scale generative models, as the initial retrieval phase narrows down the context and thus the volume of data that needs to be processed in the generation phase.

## 3. How is retrieval augmented generation being used today?
These are some real-life examples of how RAG models are being used today to:
#### 3.1. Improve customer support
RAG can be used to build advanced chatbots or virtual assistants that deliver more personalized and accurate responses to customer queries. This can lead to faster responses, increased operational efficiencies, and eventually, greater customer satisfaction with support experiences.
#### 3.2. Generate content
RAG can help businesses produce blog posts, articles, product catalogs, or other content by combining its generative capabilities with retrieving information from reliable sources, both external and internal.
#### 3.3. Perform market research
By gathering insights from the vast volumes of data available on the internet—such as breaking news, industry research reports, even social media posts—RAG can keep businesses updated on market trends and even analyze competitors’ activities, helping businesses make better decisions.
#### 3.4.Support sales
RAG can serve as a virtual sales assistant, answering customers’ questions about items in inventory, retrieving product specifications, explaining operating instructions, and in general, assisting in the purchasing lifecycle. By marrying its generative abilities with product catalogs, pricing information, and other data—even customer reviews on social media—RAG can offer personalized recommendations, address customers’ concerns, and improve shopping experiences.
#### 3.5. Improve employee experience
RAG can help employees create and share a centralized repository of expert knowledge. By integrating with internal databases and documents, RAG can give employees accurate answers to questions about company operations, benefits, processes, culture, organizational structure, and more.
